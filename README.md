# TOH-project
Weather prediction using a weather API 
#Franck: my three new questions are: 1. Create a bar chart for the temperature of the next few dates. 2. calculate the mean, word count etc. 3. extract temperature, day time, days and wind direction.
Data Retrieval and Display:
	◦	Fetch data from an external API and display it in your application.
	◦	Implement filtering or search functionality to query the API for specific data.
Authentication and Authorization:
	◦	Implement user authentication using an OAuth 2.0 flow and secure your API requests with tokens.
Caching and Performance:
	◦	Implement a caching mechanism for API responses to improve application performance and reduce API calls.
Error Handling:
	◦	Create a robust error-handling mechanism to gracefully handle API errors and provide meaningful feedback to users.
Rate Limiting:
	◦	Implement rate limiting to ensure that your application stays within API usage limits and doesn't exceed rate limits.
Webhooks:
	◦	Set up a webhook system to receive real-time updates from an API and process incoming data.
Data Transformation:
	◦	Convert data from the API into a format that's easier to work with in your application (e.g., mapping JSON responses to objects).
Integration Testing:
	◦	Write automated tests to ensure that your application's integration with the API is functioning correctly.
Versioning:
	◦	Handle different versions of the API gracefully to maintain compatibility with various API endpoints.
Documentation and Swagger:
	◦	Generate API documentation for your own API endpoints if you're building an API, or use Swagger/OpenAPI to consume and understand external API documentation effectively.
Third-Party Libraries:
	◦	Explore and integrate third-party libraries or SDKs that can simplify and enhance the API integration process.
Asynchronous Requests:
	◦	Implement asynchronous requests for handling multiple API calls concurrently to improve application responsiveness.
Scalability:
	◦	Consider how your application can scale when dealing with a high volume of API requests. Implement load balancing and other scalability measures.
	14	Monitoring and Logging:
	◦	Set up monitoring and logging to track API usage, performance, and errors for troubleshooting and optimization.
	15	Data Synchronization:
	◦	Develop a mechanism to synchronize data between your application and the API, ensuring data consistency.
